### **Problem Analysis**
The problem at hand is to create an attenuator controller website using Python Flask. The website should allow users to specify the attenuation across four channels using a slider ranging from 0 to 95 dBm.

### **Flask Application Design**
To solve this problem, we will design a Flask application with the following structure:

**1. HTML Files:**
   - `index.html`: This will be the main page of the website. It will contain the user interface elements, such as the sliders for controlling the attenuation levels and a button to submit the settings.
   - `results.html`: This page will display the current attenuation settings for each channel.

**2. Routes:**
   - `/`: This route will handle the main page of the website and display the `index.html` file.
   - `/update_attenuation`: This route will handle the submission of the attenuation settings. It will update the attenuation levels and redirect the user to the `results.html` page.

### **HTML Files**

**1. index.html:**
   - This file will contain the following elements:
     - A heading with the title "Attenuator Controller".
     - Four sliders, each labeled with the channel number (1-4) and a range from 0 to 95 dBm.
     - A button labeled "Submit" to submit the attenuation settings.

**2. results.html:**
   - This file will contain the following elements:
     - A heading with the title "Attenuation Settings".
     - A table with four rows, each representing a channel. The table will display the current attenuation setting for each channel.

### **Routes**

**1. /:**
   - This route will handle the main page of the website. It will render the `index.html` file.

**2. /update_attenuation:**
   - This route will handle the submission of the attenuation settings. It will:
     - Retrieve the attenuation settings from the request.
     - Update the attenuation levels.
     - Redirect the user to the `results.html` page.

### **Conclusion**
This design provides a simple and effective solution to the problem of creating an attenuator controller website using Python Flask. The application is easy to use and understand, and it can be easily customized to meet specific requirements.
